Google Colab is a free, browser-based notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud. 



####Why use Google Colab?

1. Serverless: Colab allows you to instantly spring up a Jupyter Notebook completely serverless in the browser which means that you do not have to worry about provisioning hardware, your Python version and path or if you are on Windows, MacOS or even a phone.<br/>
2. Sharing: You can share the notebook seamlessly, just like a Google Doc. <br/>
3. Free GPU: Free GPU at the click of a button.
